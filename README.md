* Glass (transparent)

* USB mic 

### Electrical 

* Oled display 0.96 inches (128x64)

* Raspberry pi (zero preferably (W*))

## Personal library Note :

Download and place the codes in this repository to your python destination ( `routes_api_check` )

## How to Make :

* Assemble the 3D printed files according to the assembly guide (`soon will be posted`)

* Download the whole and file and place it under 'snowboy/examples/Python3' in your Rpi.

* Once you have all the libraries installed its time to run the code 

* But, before that lets add this to the startup file so that this runs on boot firstly.

* Once everything is setup its time to start our smarty for the first time
